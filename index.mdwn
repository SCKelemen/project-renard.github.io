<span class="firstcharacter">P</span>roject Renard is an initiative to rethink how information is used in the
digital realm. An early dream of the researchers that created computers was to
create a "tool for thought" â€” a tool that could help them avoid the overhead
of organising information before it could become useful. We have the
technologies that are needed, but nobody has yet integrated them in a way that
creates a unified experience. This experience needs to incorparate everything
from information seeking to filing documents and ideas into a always-available database
to linking disparate thoughts into a mental model in order to make sense of it all.
