# Design considerations

Graphs are not necessarily the best way to display data since they can become
cluttered. A computer can easily render a graph with many edges, but a human
does not necessarily understand the information displayed. See [this discussion
of the Big Fat Graph][#schraefel:2006] used in the semantic web.
