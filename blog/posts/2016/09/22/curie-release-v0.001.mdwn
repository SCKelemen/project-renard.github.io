Curie, named after Marie Curie, is the first released component of Project
Renard. It is an application for reading and navigating documents.
This first release is a typical document reader. It allows for

  - opening PDF files,
  - moving between pages using buttons,
  - moving to a specific page number, and
  - navigation via an outline if the PDF file contains one.
