The second pre-alpha release of Curie is now available. It
features the following user-visible improvements:

- Zooming using the scrollwheel (Ctrl + Scroll Up to zoom in and
  Ctrl + Scroll Down to zoom out).
- Drag-and-drop of file on to the page area opens the file.

There have also been some improvements to the installation
particularly on macOS. There is now a working
[homebrew tap for installing
curie](https://github.com/project-renard/homebrew-project-renard)
that installs Curie along with its native dependencies.
