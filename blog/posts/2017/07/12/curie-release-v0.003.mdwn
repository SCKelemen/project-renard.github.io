The third pre-alpha release of Curie is now available. It
features the following user-visible improvements:

- The `File -> Recent files` menu is updated whenever 
  documents are opened.

- Continuous page view and multiple columns (e.g., for dual page display) using a grid-based view model. The page number updates as this is scrolled.

- An exception handler popup window that displays errors such as missing files or invalid page number selection.
