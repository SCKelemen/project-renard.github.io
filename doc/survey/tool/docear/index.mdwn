Docear is a tool that combines reference management with mind mapping.

It works by taking annotations created on PDFs using a separate viewer program
and allowing those annotations to be inserted into a mindmap along with other
notes.  This allows for organising notes into an outline coupled with direct
links to the papers which need to be cited.

Docear's mindmapping component is based upon the [[Freeplane|freeplane]] tool which in
turn was forked from the [[FreeMind|freemind]] tool.
