The idea behind Beagle is to create a browser plugin (like a Chrome extension)
that can be used to share information between researchers and present that
information alongside websites for research articles.

It makes uses of other existing JS tools and web APIs such as pdf.js and Open Annotator.

# Plan

Planning site: [[voyage|https://github.com/BeagleLab/voyage]].

- Download and save paper on current page
  - Add data to search results (PubMed, Google Scholar)
  - Downloading versus "starring"
- Get paper metdata
  - Metadata IDs: DOI, ISBN
  - Retrieve all DOIs from a paper and allow for choosing which one is the actual DOI for that paper
  - Generate citation: BibTeX, RIS, etc.
  - From `<meta>`: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/protocol-parser>, <https://github.com/BeagleLab/voyage/issues/7>
- Recording items on the page
  - Taking a screenshot
  - Highlighting text
  - Annotating anything that has been highlighted
  - Pinpoint to a line
  - hypothes.is integration: <https://github.com/hypothesis/pdf.js-hypothes.is>
  - Extract paper logical structure: abstract, headings, sections
- APIs to work with
  - [[Scopus|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopus]]
  - CrossRef
  - PLoS
    - Article Level Metrics API
    - Search API
  - Altmetrics
  - Google Scholar (but avoid [[EULA problems|http://stackoverflow.com/a/7587994]]
    - Maybe just link to pre-filled Google Scholar Search
    - Cited by...
  - PubMed
    - <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/id-converter-api/>
  - CiteSeer
  - Mendeley
  - ArXiv
  - <http://sciencewise.info/faq>
  - Zotero
  - CiteULike
  - <http://paperity.org/>
  - <https://plot.ly/api/>
  - <https://dev.evernote.com/doc/>
  - <https://openaccessbutton.org/>
  - Google Contacts API for sharing
- Accounts: Figshare, ORCID, Slack, ResearchGate
- Have conversation threads
  - By sharing individual annotations, people can add to a conversation around it.
  - The annotations and conversation threads can be linked to.
  - Use Markdown or WYSIWYG editor
- NLP: keyword analysis, NER, scientific terms lookup, article summarisation
- Send PDFs and annotations to people (title, URL, attachment)
- Some ideas from <http://jbenet.github.io/sci-nav/>.
- Recommendation and science of science

- Privacy: private, groups, public
  - Like Google+ circles
  - Idea: use colour codes to make it easy to distinguish.
- Social feed for trending papers, paper suggestions, paper associations
- Access supplementary data
