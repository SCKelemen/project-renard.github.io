MuPDF is a library that for parsing and rendering several page-based document
formats including PDF, XPS, and ePub. It contains both a graphics library
called Fitz along with document-specific renderers that use Fitz as their
rendering engine.

# Notes

Documentation for the library is at: <http://mupdf.com/docs/>.

MuPDF uses the prefix `fz_` (short for Fitz) as the namespace for its symbols.

Since MuPDF is written in C, it does not have language-level exception handling
support. Instead it implements library-specific macros that provide `try ...
catch` catch functionality, namely `fz_try ... fz_catch`.

When writing bindings to accomodate for this it is necessary to create wrappers
so that exceptions in MuPDF are translated to exceptions in the host language.
