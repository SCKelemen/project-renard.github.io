MuPDF is a library that for parsing and rendering several page-based document
formats including PDF, XPS, and ePub. It contains both a graphics library
called Fitz along with document-specific renderers that use Fitz as their
rendering engine.

# Notes

MuPDF uses the prefix `fz_` (short for Fitz) as the namespace for its symbols.

Since MuPDF is written in C, it does not have language-level exception handling
support. Instead it implements library-specific macros that provide `try ...
catch` catch functionality, namely `fz_try ... fz_catch`.
