## Precomposed characters

Check if the following two words give different output in a speech synthesis
engine:

1. "finish"  (normal text)
2. "ﬁnish" (with ﬁ precomposed ligature)

They should be *the same* if the engine knows about Unicode normalisation. I
did a quick check over the TTS engines/voices that I have access to
