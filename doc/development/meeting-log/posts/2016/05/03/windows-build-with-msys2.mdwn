[[!meta title="Windows build with MSYS2: locally and on Appveyor (now with New Debugging Flavour!)"]]

In order to build [[curie|https://github.com/project-renard/curie]] on Windows[^portability],
we need to build the various Perl dependencies. These Perl dependencies in turn
require native libraries such as Gtk+ 3 and Glib. Using the MSYS2 package manager, we
can install the native libraries and link against them.

The following steps show how to install the dependencies along with how I ended
up debugging the build. The following will be assuming 64-bit Windows (x86-64
architecture) throughout.

## Building locally

1. Install [MSYS2](https://msys2.github.io/). This is a straightforward install
   into the `C:\msys64` directory.

2. Start the "MinGW-w64 Win64 Shell" from the Start Menu.

3. Use the pacman manager to update the package database and install the build toolchain:

[[!format sh """
pacman -Syu
pacman -S --needed mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain autoconf automake libtool make patch mingw-w64-x86_64-libtool
"""]]

## Building on Appveyor

[^portability]: Portability is important to writing robust software and
eventually curie will have an installer of Windows, so it is best to address
any issues early through continuous integration.
