[[!meta title="Roadmap planning session"]]

From [[last time|2016/01/30/using-glade-to-build-curie-gui]], we were going to
look at the MuPDF API for the last remaining task. However, we should step back
and take a look at where we are going before moving forward and why we are
doing each thing.

First, we will look at UI functionality then move on to background processing
that is necessary to support each of those.

## UI

- Display

  
- Navigation



## Further reading

### Books

These two books discuss and compare how people use books both on paper
and on screens. There are many ideas in them both.

  book."|http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00215ED1V01Y200907ICR009]]
  Synthesis lectures on information concepts, retrieval, and services 1.1 (2009):

  information usage. CRC Press, 2004.

### Research articles

  techniques for active reading."|http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208327]]

  See the [[video|https://kenhinckley.wordpress.com/2012/05/08/paper-informal-information-gathering-techniques-for-active-reading/]] for a demo.

  of Scholarship: How to Improve the Digital Contribution of the PDF Research
  Article."|http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jep/3336451.0015.102?view=text;rgn=main]] Journal of Electronic Publishing 15.1 (2012).

  This one comes with a [[demo PDF|https://pkp.sfu.ca/files/idealizedPDF.pdf]]
  that demonstrates various aspects of what they would like to achieve
  which they compare with [[the article that they modified|http://www.italiavacance.eu/index.php/IJAR/article/download/95/102]].
  
  As you can see, the authors opt to change the way PDFs are published, but
  clearly, we can't convince everyone to do that. So instead, we will need
  to be able to reformat documents our own way.
  
  That will be the main contribution of Project Renard that nobody has
  done yet. I want to call it document resynthesis. I got the
  "resynthesis" name from a sound synthesis technique that takes existing
  sounds and takes the Fourier components and processes them in order to
  make new sounds.
