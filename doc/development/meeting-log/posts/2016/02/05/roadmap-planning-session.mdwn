[[!meta title="Roadmap planning session"]]

From [[last time|2016/01/30/using-glade-to-build-curie-gui]], we were going to
look at the MuPDF API for the last remaining task. However, we should step back
and take a look at where we are going before moving forward and why we are
doing each thing.

## Brainstorming

First, we will look at UI functionality then move on to background processing
that is necessary to support each of those.

- UI
  - Display
  - Navigation
    - back, forward
    - jump to page
    - history list (what was the last page I was at)

  - Reading order: may be embedded in the PDF or might require
    extraction
- Metadata
  - RDF database
  - Printing: cover page with metadata and QR code
  - Summary: automatic summarisation

## Implementation work

We continued work on the simple GUI by adding buttons to the Glade GUI for
jumping to the first and last pages and moving forward and backwards
one page at a time. See PR [[!template id=github item="project-renard/curie/pull/6"]].

To speed up development, we skipped creating a binding for now and
just used the `[[`mudraw`|http://mupdf.com/doc/browse/source/tools/mudraw.c]]`
command to get the PDF page as a PNG image
and `[[pdfinfo|https://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/tree/utils/pdfinfo.cc]]`
command to get the number of pages in the PDF. The following is the
result.

### Books

These two books discuss and compare how people use books both on paper
and on screens. There are many ideas in them both.

  This one comes with a [[demo PDF|https://pkp.sfu.ca/files/idealizedPDF.pdf]]
  that demonstrates various aspects of what they would like to achieve
  which they compare with [[the article that they modified|http://www.italiavacance.eu/index.php/IJAR/article/download/95/102]].
  
  As you can see, the authors opt to change the way PDFs are published, but
  clearly, we can't convince everyone to do that. So instead, we will need
  to be able to reformat documents our own way.
  
  That will be the main contribution of Project Renard that nobody has
  done yet. I want to call it document resynthesis. I got the
  "resynthesis" name from a sound synthesis technique that takes existing
  sounds and takes the Fourier components and processes them in order to
  make new sounds.
