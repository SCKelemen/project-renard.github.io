[[!meta title="some project organisation"]]

- Assigned some tasks for further work on the GUI:
    - Stan: put the drawing area in a scrollable region [[!template id=github item="project-renard/curie/issues/7"]]
    - Chirag: Add a text field for selecting page by number [[!template id=github item="project-renard/curie/issues/8"]]
    - Zaki: Set the window title to the PDF filename [[!template id=github item="project-renard/curie/issues/9"]]

- Added a section to the wiki for [[features|doc/development/feature]] that are
  found in other similar software that might be worth implementing.

  This will be supplemented with screenshots and links to example code.
