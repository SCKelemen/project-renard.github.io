## Agenda

- Record all steps taken today to a post on the project-renard wiki.
  - That means that this EtherPad document will become a page on the wiki.
- Choose a standard version of Perl 5 to work on. The code will not work on
  older versions. This is so that we can use modern features without worrying
  about backwards compatibility.
  
  Perl v5.20 is a good choice right now. It supports method signatures as a
  built-in feature.

- Set up GTK+ 3 on Linux so that it can run the **curie** code.
    - This is related to issue "GTK+ Linux setup" <https://github.com/project-renard/curie/issues/2>.

## Tasks completed

- **curie**: Install development packages for libgtk-3.0 <https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/> on Debian GNU/Linux.

    - Install the dependencies on Debian by running:
      <pre>
      cd curie
      sudo xargs apt-get install \
          -y --no-install-recommends \
          < debian-packages
      </pre>

- **base**: Make sure the version of Perl 5 you have is v5.20 or greater.
   -  If you do not have that version of Perl 5, you can use `perlbrew` to set it up.
      Follow the instructions at <http://perlbrew.pl/>.

- **base**: We will use cpanm to install the Perl modules that we need. It can be
  installed by running
  
  ```
      perlbrew install-cpanm
  ```
  
  or if you do not have perlbrew, following the instructions at
  <https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus#installing-to-system-perl>:
  
  ```
      cpan App::cpanminus
  ```

- **curie**: Removed the Gtk3::Ex::PDFViewer code which was causing problems
    - PR <https://github.com/project-renard/curie/pull/3>.

- **curie**: Install the Perl CPAN packages needed for Gtk3.
    - This can be done more easily by creating a `cpanfile` which lists the requirements.
    - PR <https://github.com/project-renard/curie/pull/4>.
    - Now that the `cpanfile` is available, you can install the dependencies by running
      
      ```
      cpanm --installdeps .
      ```

- **curie**: Install and investigate the Glade UI designer.
    - Glade can be installed by running the commands:
      ```
      sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends glade
      ```

    - There is a Glade tutorial at <http://live.gnome.org/Glade/Tutorials>.

    - We need to see if Glade <https://glade.gnome.org/> can handle the docking widgets
      that are provided by libgdl <https://developer.gnome.org/gdl/>.
