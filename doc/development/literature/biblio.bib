	Developments over the last twenty years have fueled considerable speculation
	about the future of the book and of reading itself.  This book begins with a
	gloss over the history of electronic books, including the social and technical
	forces that have shaped their development. The focus then shifts to reading and
	how we interact with what we read: basic issues such as legibility, annotation,
	and navigation are examined as aspects of reading that ebooks inherit from
	their print legacy.  Because reading is fundamentally communicative, I also
	take a closer look at the sociality of reading: how we read in a group and how
	we share what we read. Studies of reading and ebook use are integrated
	throughout the book, but Chapter 5 "goes meta" to explore how a researcher
	might go about designing his or her own reading-related studies.

	No book about ebooks is complete without an explicit discussion of content
	preparation, i.e., how the electronic book is written. Hence, Chapter 6 delves
	into the underlying representation of ebooks and efforts to create and apply
	markup standards to them. This chapter also examines how print genres have made
	the journey to digital and how some emerging digital genres might be realized
	as ebooks.  Finally, Chapter 7 discusses some beyond-the-book functionality:
	how can ebook platforms be transformed into portable personal libraries? In the
	end, my hope is that by the time the reader reaches the end of this book, he or
	she will feel equipped to perform the next set of studies, write the next set
	of articles, invent new ebook functionality, or simply engage in a heated
	argument with the stranger in seat 17C about the future of reading.

	Reading is a complex human activity that has evolved, and co-evolved, with
	technology over thousands of years. Mass printing in the fifteenth century
	firmly established what we know as the modern book, with its physical format of
	covers and paper pages, and now-standard features such as page numbers,
	footnotes, and diagrams. Today, electronic documents are enabling paperless
	reading supported by eReading technologies such as Kindles and Nooks, yet a
	high proportion of users still opt to print on paper before reading. This
	persistent habit of "printing to read" is one sign of the shortcomings of
	digital documents -- although the popularity of eReaders is one sign of the
	shortcomings of paper. How do we get the best of both worlds?

	The physical properties of paper (for example, it is light, thin, and flexible)
	contribute to the ease with which physical documents are manipulated; but these
	properties have a completely different set of affordances to their digital
	equivalents. Paper can be folded, ripped, or scribbled on almost subconsciously
	-- activities that require significant cognitive attention in their digital
	form, if they are even possible. The nearly subliminal interaction that comes
	from years of learned behavior with paper has been described as lightweight
	interaction, which is achieved when a person actively reads an article in a way
	that is so easy and unselfconscious that they are not apt to remember their
	actions later.

	Reading is now in a period of rapid change, and digital text is fast becoming
	the predominant mode of reading. As a society, we are merely at the start of
	the journey of designing truly effective tools for handling digital text.

	This book investigates the advantages of paper, how the affordances of paper
	can be realized in digital form, and what forms best support lightweight
	interaction for active reading. To understand how to design for the future, we
	review the ways reading technology and reader behavior have both changed and
	remained constant over hundreds of years. We explore the reasoning behind
	reader behavior and introduce and evaluate several user interface designs that
	implement these lightweight properties familiar from our everyday use of paper.

	We start by looking back, reviewing the development of reading technology and
	the progress of research on reading over many years. Drawing key concepts from
	this review, we move forward to develop and test methods for creating new and
	more effective interactions for supporting digital reading. Finally, we lay
	down a set of lightweight attributes which can be used as evidence-based
	guidelines to improve the usability of future digital reading technologies. By
	the end of this book, then, we hope you will be equipped to critique the
	present state of digital reading, and to better design and evaluate new
	interaction styles and technologies.
