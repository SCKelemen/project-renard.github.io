[[!meta title="Recently opened documents"]]

This feature stores a list of files that have been recently opened.

# freedesktop.org Desktop Bookmark Spec

A standard for [[storing a list of recently used
files|https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/desktop-bookmark-spec/]] has
been proposed by freedesktop.org. This list is stored using the
[[XBEL format|http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/topics/xbel/]].
The standard location for the data is `$XDG_USER_DATA/recently-used.xbel` which is often in
`$HOME/.local/share/recently-used.xbel`. This standard is used by most GTK applications.

## [[doc/survey/tool/evince]]

When opening a new instance of Evince (with no arguments) or using the menu to
select the "New Window" option, a canvas is shown that lays out thumbnails of
recent documents along with their embedded PDF title metadata or filename if
the metadata is not available. The number of documents shown on a single screen
depends on the window size.
