# freedesktop.org Desktop Bookmark Spec

A standard for [[storing a list of recently used
files|https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/desktop-bookmark-spec/]] has
been proposed by freedesktop.org. This list is stored using the
[[XBEL format|http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/topics/xbel/]].
The standard location for the data is `$XDG_USER_DATA/recently-used.xbel` which is often in
`$HOME/.local/share/recently-used.xbel`. This standard is used by most GTK applications.
