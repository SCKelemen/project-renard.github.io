[[!meta title="Recent documents"]]

## [[doc/survey/tool/evince]]

When opening a new instance of Evince (with no arguments) or using the menu to
select the "New Window" option, a canvas is shown that lays out thumbnails of
recent documents along with their embedded PDF title metadata or filename if
the metadata is not available. The number of documents shown on a single screen
depends on the window size.
